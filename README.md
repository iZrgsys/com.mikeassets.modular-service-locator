### What is dependency injection?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that reduces hard-coded dependencies between your classes by injecting these dependencies at run-time, instead of during design-time. Technically, Dependency Injection is a mechanism that allows the implementation of another, more high-level, design pattern called Inversion of Control. The purpose of both patterns is to reduce hard-coded dependencies (or ‘coupling’) between your classes.
